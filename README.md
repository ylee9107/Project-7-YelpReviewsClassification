# Project-7-YelpReviewsClassification
This project uses some of the basics of NLP (natural Language Processing) to aid in the classification of Yelp Reviews.

## Background

- In this project, Natural Language Processing (NLP) strategies will be employed to analyse some Yelp reviews data.
- Yelp is an app that provides a crowd-sourced reviews to business and services. The app is used publish customer reviews about businesses.

- It should also be noted that customers can use 'Cool', 'Useful' and 'Funny' voting labels to indicate the number of cool votes given by other Yelp Users. 

## Learning Outcomes

- basics of Natural Language Processing.
- Apply tokenization by use of the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK).
- Apply feature extraction using Count Vectorizer.
- Understand the theory behind naïve Bayes classifiers (Likelihood, prior probability and marginal likelihood.)
- Learn how to work with unbalanced dataset.
- Train a Naïve Bayes classifier model using scikit learn.
- Develop a function in python and apply it to pandas data frame
